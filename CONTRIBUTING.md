* **Write a test that fails unless your patch is present.**
  * There are fixture-based tests run by [`cat.sh`][sh-tests].
  * There are [unit-level tests][unit-tests] run by `cargo test`.
* **Write the patch to fix the test**.
* Add yourself to the `authors` line in the [`Cargo.toml`][cargo-authors] file.

### CommonMark Conformance Results

The `cargo test` suite will automatically test that `pulldown-cmark-to-cmark`
has maintained its expected conformance level against the example Markdown
programs in the CommonMark specification. As of time of writing,
**`pulldown-cmark-to-cmark` passes ~90%** of the CommonMark example program tests.

We would love your help in improving our conformance! ðŸ™‚

To view which conformance tests could use your help to fix, run:

```shell
$ FULL_CMARK_RESULTS=true cargo test
```

This will show a visual report of each failing CommonMark conformance test,
including the original Markdown, the Markdown generated by
`pulldown-cmark-to-cmark`, the expected HTML result, and a diff of the `Event`
streams of the original and regenerated Markdown.
